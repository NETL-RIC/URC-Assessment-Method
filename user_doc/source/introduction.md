Introduction
============

Unconventional Rare-earth elements & Critical minerals (URC) {cite}`osti_1891489` are crucial to a growing number of 
industries worldwide {cite}`BALARAM20191285`. Critical Minerals (CM) are minerals used in manufacturing which are essential 
to economic and national security while being vulnerable to supply disruption through any number of external factors 
{cite}`osti_1891489`. _Unconventional_ CM resources contrast with conventional CM resources in that they are sourced from 
geologic or byproduct hosts distinctly separate from the mechanisms which establish conventional CM deposits; such 
unconventional sources include _in situ_ geologic deposits and byproducts of industrial extraction 
{cite}`osti_1891489`.
 
The extraction and recovery of conventional CM is a complex process traditionally involving strip mining, 
which is both expensive and environmentally destructive {cite}`BALARAM20191285`. Recent research has revealed that 
coaliferous sediments may act as unconventional CM sources containing REE in significant concentrations 
{cite}`SEREDIN201267`; determining the likelihood and location of these resources in sedimentary basins, however, is both
complex and challenging. To address this, a new method of evaluating the potential occurrence of URC resources using a 
series of validated heuristics has been developed {cite}`CREASON2022`. 

The URC Resource Assessment Tool is used for executing the URC method step 3, the calculation of the potential enrichment score, on extant datasets generated from steps 1 & 2 of the URC method.
For description of how to use this tool, see the [Usage](usage/index.rst) section.
