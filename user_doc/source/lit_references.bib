abstract = {Rare-earth elements (REE) supply raw materials that constitute many of our modern critical infrastructure,
            defense, technology, and electrification needs. Despite REE accumulations occurring in conventional
            bedrock and ion-adsorption deposits sourced from weathering of igneous rocks, unconventional host material
            such as coal and related sedimentary strata have been identified as promising sources of REE to meet
            growing demand. To maximize the potential of unconventional resources such as REE-coal systems, new
            approaches are needed overcome challenges from mineral systems with no known deposits and areas with
            sparse geochemical data. This article presents an Unconventional Rare-earth and Critical minerals (URC)
            assessment method to predict and identify REE resource potential and occurrence in these unconventional
            systems. The method utilizes a geologic and geospatial data-driven knowledge-data approach informed and
            guided by knowledge of REE accumulation mechanisms to systematically assess and identify areas of higher
            enrichment. An assessment of the Powder River Basin is presented as a test case to demonstrate the method
            workflow and results. The key output is a Potential Enrichment (PE) score map reported with varying
            confidence levels based on the amount of supporting evidence. Results from the test case indicate several
            locations with promising potential for different types of coal-REE deposits, demonstrating the viability
            of the method for exploration and assessment of unconventional REE systemsresources. The URC method is
            flexible by design and, with sufficient applicable knowledge and data, can be adapted for assessing
            REE-bearing critical mineral systems in other sedimentary systems as well.}

abstract = { AbstractAs human exploration of the subsurface increases, there is a need for better data- and knowledge-driven methods to improve prediction of subsurface properties. Present subsurface predictions often rely upon disparate and limited a priori information. Even regions with concentrated subsurface exploration still face uncertainties that can obstruct safe and efficient exploration of the subsurface. Uncertainty may be reduced, even for areas with little or no subsurface measurements, using methodical, science-driven geologic knowledge and data. We have developed a hybrid spatiotemporal statistical-geologic approach, subsurface trend analysis (STA), that provides improved understanding of subsurface systems. The STA method assumes that the present-day subsurface is not random, but is a product of its history, which is a sum of its systematic processes. With even limited data and geologic knowledge, the STA method can be used to methodically improve prediction of subsurface properties. To demonstrate and validate the improved prediction potential of the STA method, it was applied in an analysis of the northern Gulf of Mexico. This evaluation was prepared using only existing, publicly available well data and geologic literature. Using the STA method, this information was used to predict subsurface trends for in situ pressure, in situ temperature, porosity, and permeability. The results of this STA-based analysis were validated against new reservoir data. STA-driven results were also contrasted with previous studies. Both indicated that STA predictions were an improvement over other methods. Overall, STA results can provide critical information to evaluate and reduce risks, identify and improve areas of scarce or discontinuous data, and provide inputs for multiscale modeling efforts, from reservoir scale to basin scale. Thereby, the STA method offers an ideal framework for guiding future science-based machine learning and natural language processing to optimize subsurface analyses and predictions. }
