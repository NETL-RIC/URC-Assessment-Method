abstract = { AbstractAs human exploration of the subsurface increases, there is a need for better data- and knowledge-driven methods to improve prediction of subsurface properties. Present subsurface predictions often rely upon disparate and limited a priori information. Even regions with concentrated subsurface exploration still face uncertainties that can obstruct safe and efficient exploration of the subsurface. Uncertainty may be reduced, even for areas with little or no subsurface measurements, using methodical, science-driven geologic knowledge and data. We have developed a hybrid spatiotemporal statistical-geologic approach, subsurface trend analysis (STA), that provides improved understanding of subsurface systems. The STA method assumes that the present-day subsurface is not random, but is a product of its history, which is a sum of its systematic processes. With even limited data and geologic knowledge, the STA method can be used to methodically improve prediction of subsurface properties. To demonstrate and validate the improved prediction potential of the STA method, it was applied in an analysis of the northern Gulf of Mexico. This evaluation was prepared using only existing, publicly available well data and geologic literature. Using the STA method, this information was used to predict subsurface trends for in situ pressure, in situ temperature, porosity, and permeability. The results of this STA-based analysis were validated against new reservoir data. STA-driven results were also contrasted with previous studies. Both indicated that STA predictions were an improvement over other methods. Overall, STA results can provide critical information to evaluate and reduce risks, identify and improve areas of scarce or discontinuous data, and provide inputs for multiscale modeling efforts, from reservoir scale to basin scale. Thereby, the STA method offers an ideal framework for guiding future science-based machine learning and natural language processing to optimize subsurface analyses and predictions. }

abstract = {This paper presents data on widespread abnormal accumulations of lanthanides and yttrium (REY) in many coal deposits worldwide. High REY contents (>0.1%) have been found in coal seams and coal ashes, as well as in the host and basement rocks of some coal basins. For a preliminary evaluation of coal ashes as an REY raw material, not only the abundance but also the individual REY compositions were taken into account in this paper. Three REY distribution patterns for high-REY coal ashes are fixed, with LREY- (LaN/LuN>1), MREY- (LaN/SmN<1, GdN/LuN>1), and HREY- (LaN/LuN<1) enrichment. Four genetic types of REY enrichment in coal basin can be identified: 1) terrigenous type, with REY input by surface waters; 2) tuffaceous type, connected with falling and leaching of acid and alkaline volcanic ash; 3) infiltrational or meteoric ground water driven type, and 4) hydrothermal type, connected with ascending flows of thermal mineral water and deep fluids. It is shown that the main modes of REY occurrence in high-REY coals are in fine-grained authigenic minerals (REY-bearing aluminum phosphates and sulfates of the alunite supergroup, water-bearing phosphates and carbonates) and organic compounds. Stratabound and cross-cutting REY mineralization may occur in the host and basement rocks of some coal basins. There are tuffaceous and hydrothermal types of REY mineralization outside coal seams that are significantly different in geological settings, ore body shapes, and ore compositions, as well as in REY contents and distribution patterns. The data presented indicate that coal deposits should be regarded as promising objects for recovery of REY as economic by-products of coal mining and combustion. As REY are crucial metals for alternative power and energy-efficient technologies, identification of these resources during coal exploitation and utilization may not only increase beneficiation of coal deposits themselves but also will promote humanity's further movement on the “green road”.}

abstract = {Rare earth elements (REE) include the lanthanide series elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) plus Sc and Y. Currently these metals have become very critical to several modern technologies ranging from cell phones and televisions to LED light bulbs and wind turbines. This article summarizes the occurrence of these metals in the Earth's crust, their mineralogy, different types of deposits both on land and oceans from the standpoint of the new data with more examples from the Indian subcontinent. In addition to their utility to understand the formation of the major Earth reservoirs, multi-faceted updates on the applications of REE in agriculture and medicine including new emerging ones are presented. Environmental hazards including human health issues due to REE mining and large-scale dumping of e-waste containing significant concentrations of REE are summarized. New strategies for the future supply of REE including recent developments in the extraction of REE from coal fired ash and recycling from e-waste are presented. Recent developments in individual REE separation technologies in both metallurgical and recycling operations have been highlighted. An outline of the analytical methods for their precise and accurate determinations required in all these studies, such as, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), glow discharge mass spectrometry (GD-MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (including ICP-MS, ICP-TOF-MS, HR-ICP-MS with laser ablation as well as solution nebulization) and other instrumental techniques, in different types of materials are presented.}

abstract = {Rare-earth elements (REE) supply raw materials that constitute many of our modern critical infrastructure, 
            defense, technology, and electrification needs. Despite REE accumulations occurring in conventional 
            bedrock and ion-adsorption deposits sourced from weathering of igneous rocks, unconventional host material
            such as coal and related sedimentary strata have been identified as promising sources of REE to meet 
            growing demand. To maximize the potential of unconventional resources such as REE-coal systems, new 
            approaches are needed overcome challenges from mineral systems with no known deposits and areas with 
            sparse geochemical data. This article presents an Unconventional Rare-earth and Critical minerals (URC) 
            assessment method to predict and identify REE resource potential and occurrence in these unconventional 
            systems. The method utilizes a geologic and geospatial data-driven knowledge-data approach informed and 
            guided by knowledge of REE accumulation mechanisms to systematically assess and identify areas of higher 
            enrichment. An assessment of the Powder River Basin is presented as a test case to demonstrate the method 
            workflow and results. The key output is a Potential Enrichment (PE) score map reported with varying 
            confidence levels based on the amount of supporting evidence. Results from the test case indicate several 
            locations with promising potential for different types of coal-REE deposits, demonstrating the viability 
            of the method for exploration and assessment of unconventional REE systemsresources. The URC method is 
            flexible by design and, with sufficient applicable knowledge and data, can be adapted for assessing 
            REE-bearing critical mineral systems in other sedimentary systems as well.}
